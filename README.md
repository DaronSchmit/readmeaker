# READMEAKER

### Good README Generator

## Description
This project is a basic javascript program that helps users generate a basic README with minimal effort. Let's be honest, that's one of the more annoying parts of programming anyway. This provides the user with a basic framework to add on if they wish.

## Installation
Go to https://github.com/DaronSchmit/readmeaker to view, fork, and clone the repo.

You can also download it directly here https://github.com/DaronSchmit/readmeaker/archive/main.zip If installing from the zip, you'll need to use your own archiving software to unzip and extract the file.

Otherwise, a user may go to  https://daronschmit.github.io/DaronDayScheduler/ to see the webpage deployed live, or to the GitHub repository at https://github.com/DaronSchmit/DaronDayScheduler.

## Usage
Using git bash or your favorite terminal with node installed, navigate to directory of the program and run `npm i` to install all necessary modules (which is basically just inquirer. Alternately, use `npm i inquirer`). Then run `node index.js` to run the javascript file. The new README.md file will be placed in /newREADME so as to keep it from overwriting any existing README files.
